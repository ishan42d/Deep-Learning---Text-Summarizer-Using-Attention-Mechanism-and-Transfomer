# Deep-Learning---Text-Summarizer-Using-Attention-Mechanism-and-Transformer
In this code, you will understand how to create a deep learning NLP model that will help you build a text summarizer from scratch. You can use your own input to test this out. Built using TF and Trax.

The model is built using the Attention mechanism and Transformer models namely:
1. Dot Product attention
2. Causal attention 
3. Transofmer model(decoder and language model block) capability 

All this has been built post what I have learned through the deep learning NLP specialization course. I will be reviewing from time to time in order to upgrade this model
